# MLOps-Driven Titanic Survival Prediction Pipeline

## Overview

The Titanic Survival Prediction project aims to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using machine learning. This project leverages Scikit-Learn's powerful pipeline functionality to streamline the model development process and wraps the model into a Flask application for user-friendly predictions.

## Project Structure

- **`data/`**: Contains dataset files (e.g., training and test data).
- **`notebooks/`**: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration and preprocessing.
- **`src/`**: Source code for data processing, model training, and Flask application.
  - **`pipeline.py`**: Contains Scikit-Learn pipeline configuration for preprocessing and model training.
  - **`app.py`**: Flask application code for serving the model and handling user requests.
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of dependencies needed to run the project.
- **`README.md`**: Project overview and setup instructions.

## Installation

To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/titanic-survival.git
cd titanic-survival
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
#Training the Model
1. Prepare the Data: Ensure the dataset files are located in the data/ directory.
2. Run the Pipeline: Execute the pipeline script to train the model. This will handle data preprocessing and model training.

```bash
python src/pipeline.py
```
This will save the trained model and preprocessing pipeline to disk.

#Running the Flask App
1. Start the Flask Server: Run the Flask application to serve the trained model and handle prediction requests.

```bash
python src/app.py
```
2. Access the App: Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000. You can use the web interface to input passenger details and get survival predictions.

#API Endpoints
1. POST /predict: Predict survival for a given passenger. Send a JSON payload with passenger data.

Example Request:
```bash
json
{
  "Pclass": 1,
  "Sex": "female",
  "Age": 29,
  "SibSp": 0,
  "Parch": 0,
  "Fare": 71.2833,
  "Embarked": "C"
}
```
Example Response:
```bash
json
{
  "survival": 1
}
```
